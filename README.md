With this repository you can understand basic concepts of reverse engineering and overflow techniques. You can learn about shellcode fundementals for both Linux and Windows operating systems as well. There are also some examples with binaries to figure out how fuzzing works in **binary** domain.

Each part has its own **README.md** file to understand conditions of challenges and examples.There are also tips too!

Good luck and have fun!
